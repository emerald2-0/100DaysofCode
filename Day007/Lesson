Regex
all regexes are enclosed within forward slashes.
the circumflex accent matches the beginning of the string or line.:
 - /^Once upon a time/ will match any line beginning with that sentence.
the dollar sign matches the end of the string
 - /action$/ will match any line ending with the string "ation".
Brackets are used to match a single character from the list enclsed in them.
 - /[abc]/will match either a b or c. They accept ranges as well
 - /[a-f]/  /[0-6]/  /[a-f0-6]/
asterisk is a quantifier - specifying the preceding character has to appear at least once.
 - /[ab]\*/ will match abab, aaaaa, but will also match an empty string.
+ sign - the preceeding character will have to appear at least once.
 - matches * except the empty strings.
{} used when we want to specify the number of times the preceeding character should appear.
 - If you want a string that contains 4 to 8 characters we can use: {4, 8} to validate it.
